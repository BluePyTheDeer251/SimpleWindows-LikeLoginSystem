Hello! Welcome to my first repository, this is my first ever project on GitHub, it works as it follows:
1. Download pass.py (the code)
2. Use your favorite editor or IDE
3. Edit the inSystem_user and inSystem_password variables' content (optional)
4. You run the code (so obvious)
5. You enter a user and a password so the system can check if something is True or False
6. Enjoy the results!
